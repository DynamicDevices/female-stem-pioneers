- Individual info cards with biography, achievements, quotes, fun facts, and inspirational resources
- Modern, responsive UI with category badges, section highlights, and accessible design
- Images for each pioneer (photo, artistic, or symbolic if no photo exists)

- Easy to add new pioneers via `add-pioneer.js`

The project is suitable for educational, outreach, and inspirational purposes.
