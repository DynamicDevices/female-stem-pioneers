    "shortDescription": "Ada Lovelace is often called the world's first computer programmer. She worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine and wrote the first algorithm meant for a machine. Ada believed that computers could do more than just math—they could create music and art, too! Her creative ideas inspire people to combine technology and imagination.",
    "detailed_description": {
      "early_life": "Born in 1815 to the famous poet Lord Byron, Ada was encouraged by her mother to study mathematics and science. She showed exceptional talent from an early age and was tutored by leading scientists of the day.",
      "stem_journey": "At age 17, Ada met Charles Babbage and became fascinated by his mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. She translated an article about it and added her own notes, including the first computer program ever written.",
      "challenges": "As a woman in 19th-century England, Ada faced expectations to focus on domestic roles rather than science. She also struggled with health issues throughout her life.",
      "achievements": "Ada wrote the first computer program - an algorithm for calculating numbers. She also predicted that computers could create music and graphics, envisioning their creative potential long before others.",
      "legacy": "Ada is considered the first computer programmer, and the programming language Ada is named in her honor. She inspires millions of women in computer science today."
