  "summary": "Mathematician who was one of the first African American women to earn a PhD in mathematics and worked on NASA's space program.",
  "shortDescription": "Evelyn Boyd Granville was the second African American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics and worked as a computer programmer for NASA during the space race. She helped calculate rocket trajectories and orbital paths for early space missions. Evelyn's work showed that women of color could excel in both pure mathematics and applied computer science, inspiring future generations of mathematicians and programmers.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1924 in Washington, D.C., Evelyn showed exceptional talent in mathematics from an early age. She earned her PhD in mathematics from Yale University in 1949.",
    "stem_journey": "Evelyn worked as a mathematician and computer programmer for NASA, helping calculate rocket trajectories for space missions. She later became a professor and inspired many students.",
    "challenges": "Faced racial and gender discrimination in mathematics and computer science, had to prove herself in male-dominated fields, and overcame barriers to education.",
    "achievements": "Second African American woman to earn PhD in mathematics, worked on NASA space missions, and became a professor inspiring future mathematicians.",
    "legacy": "Pioneered the path for African American women in mathematics and computer science, showing that excellence knows no color or gender."
