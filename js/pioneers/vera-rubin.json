    "early_life": "Born in Philadelphia in 1928, Vera was fascinated by astronomy from childhood. She earned her PhD in astronomy from Georgetown University in 1954.",
    "stem_journey": "Vera's research focused on galaxy rotation curves. Her observations showed that galaxies rotate faster than expected, providing evidence for dark matter's existence.",
    "challenges": "As a woman in astronomy in the 1950s and 1960s, Vera faced significant gender discrimination. She was often excluded from major observatories and had to fight for access to telescopes.",
    "achievements": "Provided first direct evidence for dark matter through galaxy rotation studies, discovered the Rubin-Ford effect, and was the first woman to receive the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.",
    "legacy": "Vera's work on dark matter fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe and inspired generations of women in astronomy."
