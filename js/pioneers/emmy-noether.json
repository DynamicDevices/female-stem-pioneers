  "quote": "My methods are really methods of working and thinking; this is why they have crept in everywhere anonymously.",
  "summary": "Revolutionary mathematician who developed Noether's theorem, connecting symmetry and conservation laws in physics.",
  "shortDescription": "Emmy Noether was a brilliant mathematician who changed how we understand the universe. She discovered that symmetry in nature leads to conservation laws - like how the symmetry of time leads to conservation of energy. Albert Einstein called her the most important woman in mathematics. Her work helps physicists understand everything from particle physics to black holes.",
