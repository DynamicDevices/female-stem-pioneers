  "quote": "The excitement of learning separates youth from old age. As long as you're learning, you're not old.",
  "summary": "Nobel Prize-winning medical physicist who developed radioimmunoassay, revolutionizing medical testing.",
  "shortDescription": "Rosalyn Yalow was a Nobel Prize-winning medical physicist who developed radioimmunoassay, a technique that revolutionized medical testing. Her work made it possible to measure tiny amounts of hormones and other substances in the blood, leading to better diagnosis and treatment of diseases.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1921 in New York City, Rosalyn showed exceptional talent in mathematics and science from an early age. She graduated from Hunter College at age 19 and earned her PhD in nuclear physics from the University of Illinois.",
    "stem_journey": "Rosalyn began her career at the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital where she developed radioimmunoassay (RIA) with Solomon Berson. This technique revolutionized medical testing by allowing scientists to measure tiny amounts of hormones and other substances in the blood.",
    "challenges": "Rosalyn faced discrimination as a woman in physics and was often the only woman in her department. She also had to balance her career with family responsibilities and faced skepticism about her new medical testing technique.",
    "achievements": "Rosalyn developed radioimmunoassay, which revolutionized medical testing and won her the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1977. She was the first woman to win this prize and her technique is still used in medical laboratories worldwide.",
    "legacy": "Rosalyn's radioimmunoassay technique has saved countless lives by enabling early detection of diseases. She opened doors for women in medical physics and inspired generations of female scientists."
