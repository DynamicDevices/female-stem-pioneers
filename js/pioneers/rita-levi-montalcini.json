  "summary": "Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist who discovered nerve growth factor and lived to 103, continuing research into her 100s.",
  "shortDescription": "Rita Levi-Montalcini was a Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist who discovered nerve growth factor, a protein that helps nerve cells grow and survive. Despite facing discrimination as a Jewish woman in fascist Italy, she continued her research in secret and went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Rita lived to 103 years old and continued doing research well into her 100s, showing that passion for science has no age limit.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Turin, Italy in 1909, Rita was inspired by her family's intellectual background. Her father encouraged her education despite societal expectations for women at the time.",
    "stem_journey": "Rita studied medicine at the University of Turin and began research in neurology. During World War II, she was forced to work in secret due to anti-Jewish laws, setting up a laboratory in her bedroom.",
