  "summary": "Developed the first successful treatment for leprosy and was the first African American woman to earn a master's from the University of Hawaii.",
  "shortDescription": "Alice Ball developed the first successful treatment for leprosy (the Ball Method). She was the first woman and first African American to earn a master's from University of Hawaii. Her innovative extraction method for chaulmoogra oil provided the first effective treatment for leprosy patients, saving countless lives and improving the quality of life for those with the disease.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Seattle, Washington, Alice showed exceptional academic ability from an early age. She attended the University of Washington and later earned her master's degree from the University of Hawaii.",
    "stem_journey": "Alice became the first African American woman to earn a master's degree from the University of Hawaii. She developed the Ball Method for treating leprosy, which was the first effective treatment for the disease.",
    "challenges": "Faced racial and gender discrimination in academia and research. Her work was initially credited to others after her death, and she had to overcome significant barriers as an African American woman in science.",
    "achievements": "Developed the first successful treatment for leprosy (the Ball Method), became the first African American woman to earn a master's from University of Hawaii, and pioneered chaulmoogra oil extraction.",
    "legacy": "Her treatment method saved countless lives and improved the quality of life for leprosy patients. She inspired future generations of African American women in chemistry and medicine."
