  "summary": "Crystallographer who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on the structure and function of the ribosome.",
  "shortDescription": "Ada Yonath is a Nobel Prize-winning crystallographer who determined the structure of ribosomes, the protein-making machines in cells. Her work has been crucial for developing new antibiotics and understanding how life works at the molecular level.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1939 in Jerusalem, Israel, Ada showed early interest in science and nature. She grew up in a poor family but was encouraged to pursue education. She earned her PhD in crystallography from the Weizmann Institute of Science.",
    "stem_journey": "Ada began her career studying protein structures and became fascinated by ribosomes, the cellular machines that make proteins. She pioneered cryo-crystallography techniques to study these complex structures, often working against skepticism from the scientific community.",
    "challenges": "Ada faced skepticism from the scientific community about her approach to studying ribosomes. She also worked in a male-dominated field and had to overcome technical challenges in crystallography that many thought were impossible.",
    "achievements": "Ada determined the structure of ribosomes using cryo-crystallography and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009. Her work has been crucial for developing new antibiotics and understanding how life works at the molecular level.",
    "legacy": "Ada's work revolutionized our understanding of protein synthesis and has led to new antibiotics. She opened doors for women in crystallography and inspired countless scientists to study complex biological structures."
