  "quote": "Science makes people reach selflessly for truth and objectivity; it teaches people to accept reality, with wonder and admiration, not to mention the deep awe and joy that the natural order of things brings to the true scientist.",
  "summary": "Pioneering nuclear physicist who discovered nuclear fission but was denied the Nobel Prize due to discrimination.",
  "shortDescription": "Lise Meitner was a brilliant physicist who discovered nuclear fission - the process that powers nuclear reactors and atomic bombs. She worked with Otto Hahn for 30 years, but when they discovered fission, only Hahn received the Nobel Prize. Lise's story shows how women's contributions were often overlooked, even when they made groundbreaking discoveries.",
