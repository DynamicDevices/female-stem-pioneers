  "birthDate": "1906",
  "deathDate": "1972",
  "country": "Germany/United States",
  "fields": [
    "Physics",
    "Nuclear Physics"
  ],
  "roles": [
    "Physicist",
    "Nobel Laureate"
  ],
  "summary": "Nobel Prize-winning physicist who developed the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus.",
  "shortDescription": "Maria Goeppert Mayer was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who developed the nuclear shell model, explaining how protons and neutrons are arranged in the atomic nucleus. She was only the second woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics and her work laid the foundation for our understanding of nuclear structure.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1906 in Kattowitz, Germany (now Poland), Maria showed exceptional talent in mathematics and physics from an early age. Her father was a professor of pediatrics who encouraged her scientific interests.",
    "stem_journey": "Maria studied physics at the University of Göttingen, earning her PhD in 1930. She moved to the United States with her husband Joseph Mayer and worked at various universities, often without pay due to anti-nepotism rules.",
    "challenges": "Maria faced discrimination as a woman in physics and was often denied paid positions due to university anti-nepotism rules. She worked as a volunteer researcher for many years while her husband had paid positions.",
    "achievements": "Maria developed the nuclear shell model, explaining how protons and neutrons are arranged in atomic nuclei like layers in an onion. She won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, becoming only the second woman to win this prize.",
    "legacy": "Maria's nuclear shell model is fundamental to our understanding of nuclear physics and has applications in nuclear power and medical imaging. She opened doors for women in theoretical physics."
