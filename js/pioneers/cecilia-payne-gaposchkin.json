  "quote": "The reward of the young scientist is the emotional thrill of being the first person in the history of the world to see something or to understand something.",
  "summary": "Astronomer who discovered that stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium.",
  "shortDescription": "Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was an astronomer who discovered that stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, not iron as previously thought. Her PhD thesis was called 'the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy' and revolutionized our understanding of the universe.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1900 in England, Cecilia showed exceptional talent in science and mathematics from an early age. She attended Cambridge University where she studied physics and astronomy, becoming one of the few women in the field.",
    "stem_journey": "Cecilia moved to the United States to study at Harvard College Observatory, where she earned her PhD in astronomy. Her groundbreaking thesis discovered that stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, revolutionizing our understanding of stellar composition.",
    "challenges": "Cecilia faced discrimination as a woman in astronomy and was often denied opportunities because of her gender. She also had to work against established scientific beliefs about stellar composition.",
    "achievements": "Cecilia discovered that stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, not iron as previously thought. She became the first woman to become a professor at Harvard Astronomy and revolutionized our understanding of the universe.",
    "legacy": "Cecilia's discovery revolutionized astronomy and our understanding of stellar composition. She opened doors for women in astronomy and inspired generations of female scientists."
