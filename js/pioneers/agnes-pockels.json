  "summary": "Self-taught chemist who pioneered surface chemistry and invented the surface film balance.",
  "shortDescription": "Agnes Pockels was a self-taught chemist who pioneered surface chemistry and invented the surface film balance. She contributed to the field of surface science and was the first woman to receive the Davy Medal. Her work on surface tension and thin films laid the foundation for modern surface chemistry and has applications in materials science and nanotechnology.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Italy and raised in Germany, Agnes showed an early interest in science despite limited formal education opportunities for women. She conducted her research at home using equipment she built herself.",
    "stem_journey": "Agnes became a self-taught chemist who pioneered surface chemistry research. She invented the surface film balance and conducted groundbreaking research on surface tension and thin films.",
    "challenges": "Faced significant gender barriers in science education and had to conduct research independently at home. She worked without formal laboratory access or institutional support.",
    "achievements": "Invented the surface film balance, pioneered surface chemistry research, and published over 20 scientific papers. Her work laid the foundation for modern surface science.",
    "legacy": "Agnes opened doors for women in chemistry and demonstrated that important scientific discoveries could be made outside traditional academic institutions."
