  "quote": "One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.",
  "summary": "First woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win in two different sciences.",
  "shortDescription": "Marie Curie was a brilliant scientist who discovered the elements polonium and radium. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win in two different sciences—Physics and Chemistry. Her research led to life-saving medical advances like X-rays and cancer treatments. Marie's determination and curiosity opened doors for women in science everywhere.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Poland in 1867, Marie showed exceptional talent in school despite restrictions on Polish students. Her parents were teachers who emphasized education, and she worked as a governess to save money for university.",
    "stem_journey": "Marie moved to Paris in 1891 to study at the Sorbonne, often going without food to afford her studies. She earned degrees in physics and mathematics, then began research with Pierre Curie, whom she married.",
    "challenges": "Marie faced discrimination as a woman in science and was denied admission to the University of Warsaw because she was female. She worked in poverty and faced resistance from male colleagues throughout her career.",
    "achievements": "Marie discovered two new elements - polonium and radium - and used the term 'radioactivity.' She won Nobel Prizes in both Physics (1903) and Chemistry (1911), the first person to win in two different sciences.",
    "legacy": "Marie opened doors for women in science worldwide. Her research led to X-ray technology and cancer treatments. She remains a symbol of scientific excellence and determination."
