  "quote": "The most damaging phrase in the language is 'We've always done it this way!'",
  "summary": "Pioneering computer scientist who developed the first compiler and popularized the term 'debugging'.",
  "shortDescription": "Grace Hopper was a pioneering computer scientist who developed the first compiler and popularized the term 'debugging'. She was instrumental in the development of COBOL, a programming language that is still widely used today. As a Navy Admiral, she broke barriers for women in both technology and the military, becoming the first woman to receive the National Medal of Technology and inspiring generations of programmers.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in New York City, Grace showed exceptional mathematical ability from an early age. She was curious about how things worked and often took apart household items to understand their mechanisms.",
    "stem_journey": "Grace earned her PhD in mathematics from Yale University in 1934, one of only a few women with doctorates in mathematics at the time. She joined the Navy during World War II and worked on the Harvard Mark I computer.",
    "challenges": "Faced gender discrimination in both academia and the military. She was often the only woman in her technical teams and had to prove herself repeatedly in male-dominated environments.",
    "achievements": "Developed the first compiler, led development of COBOL programming language, and became the first woman to reach the rank of Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy.",
    "legacy": "Revolutionized computer programming and paved the way for women in computer science and the military. Her work made computers accessible to non-technical users."
