  "shortDescription": "Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin was a British chemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for developing protein crystallography. She determined the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, revolutionizing our understanding of biomolecules. Her work laid the foundation for modern drug development and structural biology.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1910 in Cairo, Egypt, Dorothy showed an early interest in chemistry and crystals. She was educated in England and began studying chemistry at Oxford University.",
    "stem_journey": "Dorothy began her career studying X-ray crystallography and worked with J.D. Bernal. She developed techniques to determine the structures of complex biomolecules, including penicillin and vitamin B12.",
    "challenges": "As a woman in chemistry, Dorothy faced gender discrimination. She also worked with complex crystallography techniques that required years of painstaking work.",
    "achievements": "Dorothy determined the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin using X-ray crystallography. She won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and made numerous contributions to structural biology.",
    "legacy": "Dorothy's work revolutionized our understanding of biomolecules and laid the foundation for modern drug development. She inspired generations of women in chemistry and crystallography."
