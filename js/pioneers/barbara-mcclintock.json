  "summary": "Nobel Prize-winning geneticist who discovered transposable elements (jumping genes) in maize.",
  "shortDescription": "Barbara McClintock was a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist who discovered transposable elements, or 'jumping genes,' in corn plants. Her groundbreaking research showed that genes can move around in DNA, which was revolutionary at the time. Despite being ignored by the scientific community for decades, she persisted in her research and eventually won the Nobel Prize, proving that sometimes the most important discoveries take time to be recognized.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1902 in Connecticut, Barbara showed early interest in science and independence. She earned her PhD in botany and began studying genetics at Cornell University.",
    "stem_journey": "Barbara pioneered the field of cytogenetics, studying chromosomes in corn plants. She discovered transposable elements but her work was largely ignored for decades.",
    "challenges": "Faced skepticism and rejection from the scientific community for decades, worked in isolation, and had to prove her revolutionary findings.",
    "achievements": "Discovered transposable elements (jumping genes), won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983, and revolutionized understanding of genetics.",
    "legacy": "Her discovery of transposable elements revolutionized genetics and showed that genes can move around in DNA, leading to new understanding of evolution and disease."
