  "summary": "Physicist and university president who was the first African American woman to earn a doctorate from MIT.",
  "shortDescription": "Shirley Ann Jackson was the first African American woman to earn a doctorate from MIT and the first woman to lead a top-ranked research university. She was a physicist and advocate for science education, serving as president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Her leadership has opened doors for women and minorities in STEM fields.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Washington, D.C., Shirley showed exceptional academic ability from an early age. She was encouraged by her parents to pursue education and was inspired by the space race and scientific discoveries of the 1950s and 1960s.",
    "stem_journey": "Shirley attended MIT in the 1960s, where she was often the only African American woman in her classes. She earned her PhD in theoretical elementary particle physics, becoming the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from MIT.",
    "challenges": "Faced both racial and gender discrimination in academia and physics. She was often the only African American woman in her classes and research environments, requiring her to prove herself repeatedly.",
    "achievements": "Became the first African American woman to earn a PhD from MIT, served as president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and chaired the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
    "legacy": "Opened doors for women and minorities in physics and engineering. Her leadership in academia and government has inspired generations of underrepresented students in STEM."
