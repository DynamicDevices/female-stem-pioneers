  "summary": "German chemist who co-discovered rhenium and predicted nuclear fission.",
  "shortDescription": "Ida Noddack was a German chemist who co-discovered the element rhenium and was the first to predict nuclear fission. Her work on element 75 (rhenium) with her husband Walter Noddack was groundbreaking, and her prediction of nuclear fission was ahead of its time.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1896 in Germany, Ida showed early interest in chemistry and science. She studied chemistry at the Technical University of Berlin and earned her PhD in 1921, becoming one of the first women to earn a doctorate in chemistry in Germany.",
    "stem_journey": "Ida worked with her husband Walter Noddack on analytical chemistry and the search for new elements. In 1925, they co-discovered rhenium (element 75), and Ida became the first woman to discover a chemical element.",
    "challenges": "Ida faced discrimination as a woman in chemistry and was often overshadowed by her husband in publications. Her prediction of nuclear fission in 1934 was largely ignored by the scientific community, possibly due to gender bias.",
    "achievements": "Ida co-discovered rhenium in 1925 and was the first to predict nuclear fission in 1934. She pioneered analytical chemistry techniques and made important contributions to our understanding of the periodic table.",
    "legacy": "Ida's discovery of rhenium and prediction of nuclear fission were groundbreaking contributions to chemistry and physics. She opened doors for women in analytical chemistry and demonstrated that women could make fundamental discoveries in science."
