  "summary": "Mathematician whose work on satellite geodesy was crucial to the development of GPS.",
  "shortDescription": "Gladys West was a mathematician whose work on satellite geodesy was crucial to the development of GPS. She pioneered satellite geodesy and developed mathematical modeling for GPS. Her work was inducted into the Air Force Space and Missile Pioneers Hall of Fame, and she helped create the mathematical foundation for the global positioning system we use today.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in rural Virginia, Gladys showed exceptional mathematical ability from an early age. She earned a scholarship to Virginia State College and later earned her master's degree in mathematics.",
    "stem_journey": "Gladys worked at the Naval Surface Warfare Center for 42 years, where she developed mathematical models for satellite geodesy. Her work on satellite data processing was crucial to the development of GPS technology.",
    "challenges": "Faced racial and gender discrimination in mathematics and engineering. She worked in a male-dominated field during the 1950s and 1960s, often being the only African American woman in her department.",
    "achievements": "Pioneered satellite geodesy, developed mathematical modeling for GPS, and was inducted into the Air Force Space and Missile Pioneers Hall of Fame. Her work was fundamental to modern GPS technology.",
    "legacy": "Gladys opened doors for African American women in mathematics and engineering. Her work on GPS has revolutionized navigation and location-based services worldwide."
