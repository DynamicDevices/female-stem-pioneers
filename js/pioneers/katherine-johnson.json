  "quote": "I counted everything. I counted the steps to the road, the steps up to church, the number of dishes and silverware I washed... anything that could be counted, I did.",
  "summary": "NASA mathematician whose calculations were critical to the success of early space missions.",
  "shortDescription": "Katherine Johnson was a brilliant mathematician who calculated the trajectories for NASA's first space missions, including the Apollo 11 moon landing. She worked at NASA when computers were people, not machines, and her precise calculations helped ensure the safety of astronauts. Katherine broke barriers as a Black woman in a male-dominated field and inspired the movie 'Hidden Figures.' Her work literally launched humanity into space.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, Katherine showed exceptional mathematical ability from an early age. She graduated from high school at 14 and college at 18, displaying extraordinary talent in mathematics.",
    "stem_journey": "Katherine worked as a teacher before joining NASA's predecessor NACA in 1953. She calculated trajectories for space missions when computers were people, not machines, and her work was trusted by astronauts.",
    "challenges": "Faced both racial and gender discrimination as a Black woman in a male-dominated field. She had to prove herself repeatedly and was often excluded from important meetings.",
    "achievements": "Calculated trajectories for Apollo 11 moon landing, verified computer calculations for John Glenn's flight, and worked on the Space Shuttle program. Her calculations were critical to space mission success.",
    "legacy": "Inspired millions through the movie 'Hidden Figures' and showed that women of color can excel in mathematics and science. Her work literally launched humanity into space."
