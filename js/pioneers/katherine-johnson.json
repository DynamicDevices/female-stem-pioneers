  "country": "United States",
  "fields": ["Mathematics", "Aerospace"],
  "roles": ["Mathematician", "NASA Scientist", "Educator"],
  "quote": "We will always have STEM with us. Some things will drop out of the public eye and go away, but there will always be science, engineering, and technology. And there will always, always be mathematics.",
  "summary": "African-American mathematician whose calculations were critical to the success of NASA's space missions, including the first American orbital flight.",
  "shortDescription": "Katherine Johnson was a pioneering African-American mathematician whose calculations were critical to the success of NASA's space missions, including John Glenn's orbital flight. Her work broke barriers for women and people of color in STEM.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in West Virginia, Katherine showed exceptional talent in mathematics from a young age. She graduated from high school at 14 and college at 18.",
    "stem_journey": "Katherine joined NACA (later NASA) in 1953, where she calculated flight trajectories for historic missions, including Alan Shepard's and John Glenn's flights.",
    "challenges": "As a Black woman in the segregated South, Katherine faced racial and gender discrimination throughout her career.",
    "achievements": "Calculated trajectories for the first American in space and the first American orbital flight. Her work was essential to the Apollo 11 moon landing.",
    "legacy": "Katherine's story inspired the book and film 'Hidden Figures' and paved the way for future generations of women and minorities in STEM."
