  "quote": "I am not in the slightest bit interested in the discovery of pulsars. What I am interested in is the discovery of pulsars by a woman.",
  "summary": "Discovered pulsars as a graduate student, revolutionizing our understanding of neutron stars.",
  "shortDescription": "Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered pulsars as a graduate student, one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the 20th century. Despite her crucial role in the discovery, she was controversially excluded from the Nobel Prize awarded to her supervisor.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Northern Ireland in 1943, Jocelyn was interested in science from an early age. She studied physics at the University of Glasgow and later at Cambridge University.",
    "stem_journey": "As a PhD student at Cambridge, Jocelyn helped build a radio telescope and discovered the first pulsar in 1967. She went on to discover three more pulsars.",
    "challenges": "As a woman in physics in the 1960s, Jocelyn faced significant discrimination. Her discovery of pulsars was initially attributed to her male supervisor, who received the Nobel Prize without her.",
    "achievements": "Discovered the first pulsar, discovered three additional pulsars, and made fundamental contributions to our understanding of neutron stars and the universe.",
    "legacy": "Jocelyn's discovery of pulsars revolutionized astronomy and our understanding of neutron stars. She has become a strong advocate for women in science."
