  "quote": "Algebra is but written geometry and geometry is but written algebra.",
  "summary": "Pioneered elasticity theory and made contributions to number theory despite facing gender barriers.",
  "shortDescription": "Sophie Germain was a self-taught mathematician who made foundational contributions to number theory and elasticity theory. She was the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences. Despite facing significant gender barriers in 18th-century France, she made important contributions to mathematics and physics, including work on Fermat's Last Theorem.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Paris in 1776, Sophie was largely self-taught in mathematics. During the French Revolution, she spent time in her family's library studying mathematics, developing a passion for the subject despite her family's disapproval.",
    "stem_journey": "Sophie corresponded with leading mathematicians including Gauss and Legendre, often using a male pseudonym to avoid gender discrimination. She made significant contributions to number theory and elasticity theory.",
    "challenges": "Faced severe gender discrimination in mathematics. Had to use a male pseudonym to correspond with other mathematicians. Her family disapproved of her mathematical studies, and she was denied formal education opportunities.",
    "achievements": "Pioneered elasticity theory, made contributions to Fermat's Last Theorem, and became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences. Her work on number theory was foundational.",
    "legacy": "Sophie opened doors for women in mathematics and inspired future generations of female mathematicians. Her work on elasticity theory has applications in engineering and physics."
