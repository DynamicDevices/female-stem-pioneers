  "quote": "Science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated.",
  "summary": "Chemist whose X-ray diffraction images of DNA were crucial to understanding its double helix structure.",
  "shortDescription": "Rosalind Franklin's X-ray diffraction images of DNA were crucial to understanding its double helix structure. Her work laid the foundation for the discovery of the structure of DNA and the understanding of genetic inheritance. Despite her critical contributions to one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 20th century, her work was initially overlooked, highlighting the importance of recognizing all contributors to scientific breakthroughs.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in London to a prominent Jewish family, Rosalind showed exceptional academic ability from an early age. She was determined to pursue a career in science despite family expectations for women.",
    "stem_journey": "Rosalind earned her PhD in physical chemistry from Cambridge University and became an expert in X-ray crystallography. Her work on DNA structure at King's College London produced the famous 'Photo 51' that revealed the double helix.",
    "challenges": "Faced gender discrimination in science and was often excluded from important discussions about her own research. Her work was shared without her permission, leading to the Nobel Prize being awarded to others.",
    "achievements": "Produced the crucial X-ray diffraction images of DNA that revealed its double helix structure, pioneered crystallography techniques, and made significant contributions to understanding virus structures.",
    "legacy": "Her work was fundamental to understanding DNA structure, though she wasn't recognized during her lifetime. She inspired generations of women in science and highlighted the importance of proper attribution."
