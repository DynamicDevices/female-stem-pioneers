  "quote": "You should know how many incompetent men I had to compete withâ€”in vain.",
  "summary": "Discovered the Earth's inner core, revolutionizing our understanding of the planet's structure.",
  "shortDescription": "Inge Lehmann discovered the Earth's inner core, revolutionizing our understanding of the planet's structure. She pioneered seismology and was the first woman to receive the William Bowie Medal. Her analysis of seismic waves revealed that the Earth has a solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core, fundamentally changing our understanding of Earth's interior.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, Inge showed exceptional mathematical ability from an early age. She studied mathematics and physics at the University of Copenhagen and later specialized in seismology.",
    "stem_journey": "Inge became a pioneering seismologist who analyzed seismic wave data to understand Earth's structure. Her careful analysis of earthquake data led to the discovery of Earth's inner core in 1936.",
    "challenges": "Faced significant gender discrimination in geophysics and had to compete with male colleagues who often received more recognition. She worked in a male-dominated field during the early 20th century.",
    "achievements": "Discovered Earth's inner core, pioneered modern seismology, and became the first woman to receive the William Bowie Medal. Her work fundamentally changed our understanding of Earth's structure.",
    "legacy": "Inge revolutionized our understanding of Earth's interior and opened doors for women in geophysics. Her discovery of the inner core is fundamental to modern Earth science."
