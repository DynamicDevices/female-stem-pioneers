  "quote": "Since the variables are probably at nearly the same distance from the Earth, their periods are apparently associated with their actual emission of light.",
  "summary": "Discovered the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variable stars, enabling measurement of cosmic distances.",
  "shortDescription": "Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered the relationship between the brightness and period of Cepheid variable stars, which became the key to measuring distances in the universe. Her discovery enabled Edwin Hubble to prove the existence of other galaxies.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in Massachusetts in 1868, Henrietta studied astronomy at Radcliffe College and graduated in 1892. She was partially deaf from an early age.",
    "stem_journey": "Henrietta joined the Harvard College Observatory in 1893 and began studying variable stars in the Magellanic Clouds. She discovered the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables.",
    "challenges": "As a woman in astronomy, Henrietta was paid only 30 cents per hour and was not allowed to use telescopes herself. She worked as a 'computer' analyzing photographic plates.",
    "achievements": "Discovered the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables, which became the foundation for measuring cosmic distances and understanding the scale of the universe.",
    "legacy": "Henrietta's discovery enabled astronomers to measure distances to galaxies and ultimately led to the discovery that the universe is expanding."
