  "shortDescription": "Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman in space, flying aboard Vostok 6 in 1963 and completing 48 orbits of Earth. She was selected from over 400 applicants and became a symbol of women's capabilities in space exploration. Her historic flight proved that women could handle the physical and mental challenges of space travel, opening the door for future female astronauts and cosmonauts.",
