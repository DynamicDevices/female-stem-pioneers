  "shortDescription": "Mary Anning was a self-taught fossil hunter who discovered the first complete ichthyosaur skeleton and made groundbreaking paleontological discoveries. Despite having no formal education, she became one of the most important fossil hunters of the 19th century. Mary's discoveries helped establish the field of paleontology and proved that women could make significant contributions to science even without formal training.",

    "early_life": "Born in 1799 in Lyme Regis, England, Mary grew up in poverty. Her father was a cabinetmaker who collected fossils to sell, and Mary learned fossil hunting from him. At age 11, her father died, leaving the family destitute.",
    "stem_journey": "Mary began fossil hunting to support her family, selling fossils to tourists and scientists. She taught herself anatomy, geology, and scientific illustration. Despite having no formal education, she became an expert in fossil identification and preparation.",
    "challenges": "Mary faced extreme poverty and was often excluded from scientific circles because she was a woman and had no formal education. Male scientists often took credit for her discoveries, and she struggled to make a living from her work.",
    "achievements": "Mary discovered the first complete ichthyosaur skeleton at age 12, the first complete plesiosaur skeleton, and the first pterosaur outside Germany. Her discoveries helped establish the field of paleontology and proved that women could excel in science.",
    "legacy": "Mary's discoveries revolutionized our understanding of prehistoric life. She proved that women could make significant contributions to science without formal education, inspiring generations of female scientists."
