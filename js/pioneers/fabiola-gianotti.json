    "early_life": "Born in 1960 in Milan, Italy, Fabiola showed an early interest in science and music. She excelled in school and was particularly drawn to physics and mathematics. Her parents supported her education, and she developed a passion for understanding the fundamental laws of nature.",
    "stem_journey": "Fabiola earned her PhD in particle physics from the University of Milan in 1989. She joined CERN in 1987 and began working on particle physics experiments. Her expertise in experimental physics and leadership skills led her to become the spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment.",
    "challenges": "As a woman in physics leadership, Fabiola faced the challenge of being taken seriously in a male-dominated field. She also had to balance her scientific work with administrative responsibilities as she rose to leadership positions.",
    "achievements": "Fabiola led the ATLAS experiment that discovered the Higgs boson in 2012, one of the most important discoveries in physics. She became the first woman Director-General of CERN in 2016, leading the world's largest particle physics laboratory.",
    "legacy": "Fabiola's leadership at CERN and her role in the Higgs boson discovery have made her a role model for women in physics. She has shown that women can lead the world's most advanced scientific collaborations."
