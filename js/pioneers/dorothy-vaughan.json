  "shortDescription": "Dorothy Vaughan was a NASA mathematician and computer programmer who led the West Area Computing Unit, a group of African American women mathematicians. She taught herself FORTRAN programming and became one of NASA's first computer programmers, helping to calculate rocket trajectories and orbital paths. Dorothy's leadership and adaptability showed how women could excel in both mathematics and the new field of computer programming.",
  "detailed_description": {
    "early_life": "Born in 1910 in Missouri, Dorothy showed exceptional talent in mathematics. She earned a degree in mathematics and became a teacher before joining NASA's predecessor NACA.",
    "stem_journey": "Dorothy joined NACA (later NASA) as a mathematician and became supervisor of the West Area Computing Unit. She taught herself FORTRAN programming and transitioned to computer programming.",
    "challenges": "Faced racial and gender discrimination, had to prove herself in male-dominated fields, and adapted to new technology as computers replaced human computers.",
    "achievements": "Led the West Area Computing Unit, became one of NASA's first computer programmers, and helped calculate rocket trajectories for space missions.",
    "legacy": "Pioneered the transition from human computers to computer programming and inspired African American women in STEM fields."
