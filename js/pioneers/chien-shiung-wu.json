  "shortDescription": "Chien-Shiung Wu was a brilliant physicist known as the 'First Lady of Physics.' She disproved a fundamental law of physics called the Law of Conservation of Parity, which earned her colleagues the Nobel Prize. Despite her crucial contribution, she wasn't included in the award, highlighting the challenges women faced in science. Wu's work helped advance our understanding of the universe and opened doors for women in physics.",
