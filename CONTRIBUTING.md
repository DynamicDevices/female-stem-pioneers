## How to Contribute

### Adding New Pioneer Profiles

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Add your pioneer to `js/pioneers.js`** following the current data structure (see existing entries for reference). Each entry is an object with fields such as:
   - `name`, `photo`, `birthDate`, `deathDate`, `country`, `fields`, `roles`, `quote`, `summary`, `shortDescription`, `achievements`, `fun_fact`, and additional metadata (see `add-pioneer.js` for template)
   - Only **female** pioneers are accepted. No male pioneers will be included.
   - Each pioneer must be unique by name. The system deduplicates by name, but please avoid adding duplicates. (Currently 100+ unique pioneers)
   - **Every pioneer must have a `shortDescription` field** with an engaging, student-friendly paragraph (2-3 sentences) explaining their impact and significance
   - **Real images are strongly preferred** - use JPG, WEBP, or PNG files when available. Only use `./images/placeholder.jpg` if no suitable image can be found
   - Images should be placed in `images/` and use `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.svg` (see PROJECT-REFERENCE.md for details)
   - **Only valid, non-empty images are accepted. Do not add empty or broken image files.**
   - **All fields used in the data must have an explanation in the UI.**

3. **Required fields:** `name`, `fields`, `summary`
4. **Optional fields:** See the template in `add-pioneer.js` or existing entries
