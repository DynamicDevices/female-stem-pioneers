## How to Contribute

### Adding New Pioneer Profiles

**IMPORTANT EFFICIENCY NOTE**: Before spending time researching and writing metadata for a potential new pioneer, **always check if they are already included in the project**. Use `grep` or search the `js/pioneers/` directory to verify the pioneer's name is not already present. This saves significant time and prevents duplicate work.

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Check for duplicates first** - Search the existing pioneers to ensure the person is not already included
3. **Add your pioneer to `js/pioneers/`** following the current data structure (see existing JSON files for reference). Each entry is an object with fields such as:
   - `name`, `photo`, `birthDate`, `deathDate`, `country`, `fields`, `roles`, `quote`, `summary`, `shortDescription`, `achievements`, `fun_fact`, and additional metadata (see `add-pioneer.js` for template)
   - Only **female** pioneers are accepted. No male pioneers will be included.
   - Each pioneer must be unique by name. The system deduplicates by name, but please avoid adding duplicates. (Currently 100 unique pioneers)
   - **Every pioneer must have a `shortDescription` field** with an engaging, student-friendly paragraph (2-3 sentences) explaining their impact and significance
   - **Real images are strongly preferred** - use JPG, WEBP, or PNG files when available. If no suitable image can be found, the diverse icon system will automatically provide appropriate fallback representation
   - Images should be placed in `images/` and use `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.svg` (see PROJECT-REFERENCE.md for details)
   - **Only valid, non-empty images are accepted. Do not add empty or broken image files.**
   - **All fields used in the data must have an explanation in the UI.**
   - **All images must be properly licensed for reuse** (see Image Licensing Requirements above)

3. **Required fields:** `name`, `fields`, `summary`
4. **Optional fields:** See the template in `add-pioneer.js` or existing entries

### Content Guidelines

- **Ensure biographical information is accurate and well-sourced**
- **Focus on achievements and impact that would inspire young women**
- **Include diverse representation across STEM fields, countries, and time periods**
- **Write in an engaging, accessible style appropriate for the target audience**
- **Verify information from reliable sources before submitting**
- **Remove any duplicate entries by name for clarity**
- **Verify image licensing before submitting** - include source and license information
- **Provide high-quality, comprehensive metadata** - Each pioneer should have complete information including achievements, quotes, and engaging descriptions that will inspire students
